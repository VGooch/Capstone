### Introduction

I was tasked with creating a capstone project that included: the compilation of data, analyzing the data, and providing actionable insights. In this project, I was tasked with exploring Tennessee's high school graduation requirements with median household income and  personal bankruptcy filings. When going through the data set I wanted to highlight trends to support an increase to Tennessee's graduation requirement for Personal Finance and target areas in which this could be done. For this project I used Excel and Python for data analysis and PowerPoint for data visualization.
